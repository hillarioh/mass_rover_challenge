# Mars Rover technical Challenge
- The problem below requires some kind of input. You are free to implement any mechanism for feeding input into your solution (for example, using hard coded data within a unit test). You should provide sufficient evidence that your solution is complete by, as a minimum, indicating that it works correctly against the supplied test data.
We highly recommend using a unit testing framework such as JUnit or NUnit. Even if you have not used it before, it is simple to learn and incredibly useful.
The code you write should be of production quality, and most importantly, it should be code you are proud of.
